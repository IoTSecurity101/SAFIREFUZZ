# SAFIREFUZZ
## Same-Architecture Firmware Rehosting and Fuzzing
This repository will hold the code for the USENIX Security '23 paper "Forming Faster Firmware Fuzzers", 
presenting our approach of Near-Native Rehosting.  

SAFIREFUZZ is  a throughput-optimized rehosting and fuzzing framework for ARM Cortex-M firmware.
